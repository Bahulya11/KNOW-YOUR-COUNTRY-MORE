# KNOW-YOUR-COUNTRY-MORE

It is a Machine Learning Project, where I have developed a responsive website designed to enhance our collective understanding of our nation, India. 
The features available on this website include:  
-Flashcards for memorizing various aspects such as capitals, national animals, birds, capitals, flowers, fruits, and trees.  
-Can practice as Quizzes based on the topics covered in the flashcard learning phase.  
-Informative facts about India, encompassing both historical and geographical dimensions.  
The objective of this project is to disseminate knowledge to individuals of all ages, from children as young as eight to adults up to eighty, who are eager to learn more about their homeland, India. As many are aware, utilizing flashcards is one of the most effective methods for mastering or memorizing information. Additionally, taking quizzes will assess how well the information has been retained.
